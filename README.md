#Art Collage

##App Summary

Art Collage is an application designed for creating a quick mobile art portfolio. Users can have a profile with their name, website, and bio. They can also add pictures of their artworks.

##How to Access

The application was published using Expo, and can be viewed by downloading the Expo Client app. 

Afterwards you can visit <https://exp.host/@zmcabrera/art-collage> to request a text with a link to open the project on Expo.

Unfortunately, due to recent iOS guideline [changes](https://blog.expo.io/upcoming-limitations-to-ios-expo-client-8076d01aee1a), Expo Client on iPhone only allows users to view apps they have created. 

##Using the App

When you first open the app, you will be presented with a log in screen.  To sign up, tap on `Create Account` and enter the information required. 

Once you have logged in, you will be presented with your profile. If you have created a new account, the profile will simply display your name and a placeholder profile photo. You can edit and add profile information by tapping `Edit Profile`.

To add an artwork image, simply tap on the `Add Work` icon at the bottom of the `Profile` screen. The first time you add an image, either a profile image or an artwork image, you will be prompted to allow the application to access your camera or photo gallery. These permissions must be granted separately. If you decide to take a picture, and have not authorized camera use, then you will be prompted for access to your camera. However, if you decide to upload an existing picture, and have not authorized photo gallery use, you will be prompted for access to your gallery.

After you add an artwork, you will be redirected to a page that shows the picture of your work along with a the title and description you included. If the image has no title or description, the screen will simply show the photo.

All artworks will also be visible on your profile, and you can navigate from your profile to the screen for a specific work by tapping on the artwork’s photo.

When you visit an artwork’s screen you will also be able to tap `Edit` on the top right. This will lead you to a form for changing the work’s image, title, and description. You may also choose to delete the art work by tapping `Delete` on the top right. This action will completely remove the image from your Art Collage portfolio.
